        <p>Modellesbians.com is by far my favorite website. When I am bored or curious or simply find myself aimlessly looking at a computer, I automatically click on modellesbians.com. First of all, before I compare and contrast any further, I am a lesbian. As I was saying, this website is ascetic. The background is white and the focus is an image. There are no captions: there are no personal opinions. There is simply a provocative series of quotes and images . Evidently, from the title, you can imagine that most of the images are in fact of women who are wearing or not wearing designer clothing yet there is also a rather ominous ambiance. It is not uncommon to see pictures of cuts and bruises, shadows, eerie scenes of dark street corners or a girl crying. You might see a black horse galloping on some sort of meadow or a highway.There are gifs aplenty. In short, the site is sexy and brooding.
        </p>

        <p>This website is visually stunning to me. There is something rather therapeutic about a white background, no links, no ads and a constant ongoing sequence of things to see or think about. You never have to click to move forward as you continue to scroll down you simply see older and older posts. There is no clutter. There is no branding of any sort. I find it personally refreshing. Furthermore, I personally would not classify myself as a dark individual indubitably, this website is dark. I guess it allows me to explore a different side of myself. I enjoy fashion yet, again am not an androgynous dresser: it isn/t my style and not something I would actively seek out for myself. This website does not have a function per se however, I just like to stare at it which in itself is a sign of great user experience. It's flavor appeals to me. I have shared this website with a few friends who may or may not be a part of the LGBT community and I have received positive feedback. Yet, frankly, this webiste is not for everyone.
        </p>
        <p>Modellesbians.com is not user friendly. At times, I find myself wanting to show my friend some sort of picture of some stimulating image and I will not be able to find it. There are no dates, posts are simply categorized by months. It is not browser friendly: you are forced to sort through archives. If I browse for too long, I never feel like my time was wasted. Inevitably, I have thought of some sort of topic whether it be the practicality of overalls or the modern definition of misogyny: thoughts were provoked. The site sells a solitary t-shirt: I have not bought it. I don't really wear t-shirts however, it does make me laugh. The t-shirt has a slogan: "Model Lesbians French for F**k you.
        </p>

        <p>I am a New York Times reader: I have been since my freshman year of high school when I joined the Newspaper club. However, for some reason, I get lost with a physical newspaper. Inevitably, I misplace some sort of section that I had put in a particular part of the table for later. With nytimes.com, I do not have to worry about being led astray in all the rubble of grey: I can click on a section or search my favorite NYtimes columnist who is Maureen Dowd by the way. And then I can look through all of her past columns: furthermore, I can look through other columns by other columnists on the same topic.
        </p>

        <p>I have been on a number of newspaper sites in my lifetime: la times, sf chronicle, wall street journal, etc. Nytimes is by far the most visually enticing and very up-to-date on graphics.It is not antiquated in the least which at times happens with old-school journals. Furthermore, videos, interviews as well as clips are always embedded in the articles: if one would like to delve deeper in to the depths of a certain topic it is very easy to become impassioned on the subject. Therefore, one has access to not only an article but multimedia as well. The archives also offers a spectacular look at the past. Clearly, a newspaper is informative and good-writing is engaging: the nytimes continues to take great pains in making their website up-to-date and I have yet to experience any sort of hiccup. The one pitfall that I must confess is that nytimes.com is not free: for access to more than 10 articles a month you must pay a price. I have paid this price for a number of years however, I feel like it is most definitely worth it. On there other hand, I do believe that access to a newspaper should be free and a website should be as well.>/p>

        <p>Again, this website has a white background and well-organized tables with the headings of sections of the newspaper. Although, there are a number of articles on the homepage, divides, links and a ton of advertising: I am not annoyed by all of the clutter. I simply scroll and browse through whatever I find most entertaining. User experience is definitely pleasant and the design is impressive. I have spent a number of hours on nytimes.com, at times to inform myself on a particular part of the world or the history of Chanel: it is not wikipedia yet it offers an honest history. It is incredible to me that I can literally chronicle a story: I can read through every article on any current event with the click of a button. I never waste my time and I leave feeling much more inclined to return.</p>

        <p>BuzzFeed. Oh BuzzFeed, clearly it is a pop culture website devoted to humor and wasting time. I find it charming and a natural time-killer. With labels such as "trashy", "fail", "wtf", upon entering the website you know you are in for a good time. There is definitely a great deal of clutter, my eyes are immediately drawn in all sorts of directions: you must discern what is most intriguing to you. I am personally a fan of the quizzes. Personality quizzes seem to be by far my favorite section: I have shared many a personality quiz and can tell you that I am "Daenaryus" from Game of Thrones and a "Baby-Boy Beyonce" kind of girl. All of these factors leads to a truly fun user experience. I am sure anyone who browses through BuzzFeed will find some sort of story that they are at inclines to look at whether it be politics, pop or dozens of pictures of kittens. The key feature of BuzzFeed is the constant attention to current events, the status-quo and a flair for nostalgia to the 90's.</p>

        <p>The search function is not always the best. I have searched for "Taylor Swift" and not found the series of gifs that I knew to be in existence. Regardless, there is a search function which lends itself to a somewhat easy means of browsing. Unfortunately, if I spend too much time on Buzzfeed I feel utterly useless and unenlightened. I then force myself to get off the couch and go for a run. I don't think Buzzfeed is as easy to browse as nytimes.com and Model Lesbians is by far the least user-friendly.
