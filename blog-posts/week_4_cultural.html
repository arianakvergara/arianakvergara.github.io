        <h3> Technology's Man Problem by Claire Cain Miller, NY Times </h3>

      <div id="right">
        <p>Upon my transition from med school to unemployement, I basically woke up from a very long nap. I felt like Rip Van Winkle coming back to the Bay Area. I have spent my college career and any post-graduate work not in San Francisco or Los Gatos and consequently, I had heard about the start-up boom and seen the birth of Google but not lived it. I had been told of the great 'Silicon Valley' yet it was very different coming home to face it: full frontal.
        </p>
        <p>Unsurprisingly, many of my child-hood, high-school friends are part of that tech start-up world. Some in ed-tech others starting their own companies and others simply working for the big names: regardless, one thing they have consistently told me upon hearing my interest in programming as a career is how male-dominated it actually is. Yes, at this point, it is a hackneyed and definitely over-wrought topic: many of you may stop reading right now thinking "I have heard this a thousand times before". However, before you do, I have to tell you that I take a great deal of pride in being a girl but I do not consider myself a feminist. Again the fact I am not a feminist may dissuade other readers and some of you may stop reading now. I have never really thought of my gender as a set-back or as an asset. It is what it is. I had no personal choice in the matter and even though I am 95% sure my dad wanted another boy: he got me, he dealt with it. Regardless, I am telling you that I have never really thought about what it means to be a girl in the tech world until I decided to research this topic. Initially, I thought my friends were being ridiculous when they told me to go to a female-only boot camp because they heard it was better and may lead to more self-confidence etc.. Quite frankly, I was almost forced to go to an all-girls high school: my parents are conservative and very catholic. Somehow, (thank the universe), I convinced my parents that boys were crucial to my emotional and social development with a poster presentation when I was 14.(Little did they know that boys would never interest me romantically at all. They had nothing to worry about.) Therefore, my immediate reaction to my friends was:"Are you kidding? Really? What decade are we in?" when they expressed a strong push for an all-girl enviroment.
        </p>
        <p>Yet, I must admit I was naive. I had not been very up-to-date nor had I read the plethora of articles regarding sexism and sexual harassment that seems to plague the tech world. Now that I have: I must say that I am shocked. A number of you, must have heard about the problem at Tinder. It got a great deal of news coverage and I am sure the fact that it came from a very popular dating/hook-up app also added fuel to the fire. In addition, the fact that there had once been a romantic flame between the woman filing the sexual harassment lawsuit against her ex-boyfriend also added to the soap-opera-esque quality of the story. Regardless, the fact is Ms. Whitney Wolfe the company's former vice president of marketing was repeatedly called a 'whore' by Tinder's Chief Marketing Officer, Justin Mateen, in public and he took away her 'Co-Founder' status because having a young female co-founder made the company seem like a 'joke.' That is a joke. Actually, it is bullsh*t. Clearly, this guy is pissed that Ms.Wolfe no longer finds him sexually desireable and no amount of tindering seemed to assuage his grief. As of now, Tinder is saying that these allegations are 'unfounded'. Regardless, this guy was clearly mental and he was definitely taking out his aggression in a very unprofessional way. Yet, this is not the only time this has happened. Perusing various articles, a number of women confess to having some sort of work romance that has gone awry and suddenly feeling punished and ousted from the group. Is this high school? Ms. Wolfe was brave enough to say something about it: legally. And this has led to an open discussion about how romance in the tech work-place can lead to abuse and/or a new career.
        </p>
        <p> I have to admit that most of the death threats and rape threats are directed towards women in the gaming industry: therefore, I am relieved I have no interest in gaming. I enjoy the occasional Mario-Kart game and I was in love with my purple  gameboy but that is as far as I go. Yet, isn't that rather sad? riduclous? pathetic? I am happy I am not going in to the gaming world because there are countless articles and posts discussing how horrid their work-life is. These women are afraid to walk to their cars after-dark. What is this? This is unbelievable. Furthermore, Google and Yahoo are not that much better. In the tech realm, 15% of Google employees are women and 17% of Yahoo employees are women. These are astounding numbers. There are a number of ways that men seem to rationalize these figures. One being that women were never taught to be interested in technology. Women are simply not as qualified as their male counterparts. Women are just not "*blank" enough in general. Furthermore, these big-wig tech companies have all openly stated in one way or another that they are not where they want to be when it comes to diversity. From reading a number of articles, I must confess to you that this is more of a cultural issue than a standards one. The men in the tech industry are openly mysogynistic and do not seem to have any problem blatantly stating this behind tweets, confidential e-mails and a computer screen. This is a real problem. This is not a fairy-tale made up by women who are disgruntled or looking for a job. This is very very real. The fact that men outnumber women so drastically is breeding this sort of culture and the fact there are no tangible consequences for such poor behavior is leading to even more shocking results.
        </p>
        <p> Does anyone else find it ironic that arguably the most innovative sector of the economy is stuck in the dark ages? More women apply to medical school than men. There are more female college applicants than men. Yet, in computer engineering, women admit to feeling pushed away from that industry. Fifty-six percent of women in the tech industry will leave mid-career due to feelings of being under-appreciated, demeaned or endangered. These are shocking numbers. This is an alpha-male culture that has yet to meet a Beyonce like figure to tell these men off. Where are the Iggy Azaleas? Where is the tech version of Lil Kim? Where are the Michelle Obamas? The shift in pop culture is tangible. Women are no longer only divas or jail-bait there has definitely been a shift towards the female powerhouse. Look at Hillary Clinton. Regardless of your personal views towards her political thought or the fact she is Bill Clinton's wife, she is significant in the political culture of the USA and little girls have a realistic shot at being  the next President of the USA. This revolutionary thought process needs to happen in the tech industry.
        </p>
        <p> I am floored. I am  unsure of how to react to this new information that is staring me in the face. Clearly, my friends had reason to support an all-female environment. They were looking out for my best interest and had reason to be concerned. I am concerned. There are no if's about it and since the extent of my experience with sexual harassment is a cat call, a whistle and bad flirting: I have no idea how I would react to real threats. Furthermore, the development of women-only environments for camps, hackathons or conferences breeds the notion that women are weaker or different and must be cloistered. I have never felt comfortable in an all-girl setting. I really appreciate my male friendships more than I will ever tell them. However, I would have a problem surrounded by mysoginists. What can we do? How should women move forward? Is it a matter of time?
