        <p>The most painful and heart-breaking conflict I have ever experienced was with one of my best friends: a woman who still leaves a whole in my heart to this day. Sometimes, haphazardly, my mind wanders and I will mull over the intricate weaving and finally the explosion of a truly beautiful friendship. It is one of the biggest regrets of my life that I did not handle the misunderstanding in a more mature fashion. Maybe, if I had done this? Maybe, if I had not said that? Possibly, if I had simply been more well-developed as a human being then I would still have her in my life...and I believe that would make all the difference.
        </p>
        <p>The truth is I was simply not prepared for that dinner. I believe that I am a very open-minded individual: liberal to the core. Yet, life and particularly this source of conflict may demonstrate my personal faults and some narrow views that I never knew existed. I can still replay every scene of that dinner. I had invited my friend over to my mother's house for dinner on a break from USC but I had not been prepared to meet her significant other. Upon hearing that her boo was coming as well, I set two place settings at the table. Shortly, thereafter, I heard the door bell. I ran to the door excited and elated and to my shock, her signficiant other was not what I expected. Upon hindsight, nothing should have changed but because I had only come out a year earlier: the whole situation was difficult for me to process.
        </p>
        <p>I am a lesbian. You would think that would make me entirely open to every kind of member of the LGBT community (clarification LGBTQIA community). Yet, it doesn't come with a manual. I had always known my friend as a very heterosexual woman and she still is. But her partner at that time, to me, looked like many a lesbian I had gotten accustomed to seeing in West Hollywood. My friend had mentioned to me that she had started hooking up with a transexual (female-to-male) but she was unsure and did not think it would turn in to anything serious. Because of that conversation and her rather sporadic romantic feelings, I had not taken it seriously and I should have. In front of me at the door, everything she had told me a month earlier came rushing back. I was nervous. I was confused. All sorts of feelings came rushing through me. I felt my palms get sweaty. If it had been any friend, I would have been totally ok with the situation. In fact, I would have wanted to talk about prop 8 and interrogated them on recent political developments but because I loved her so much. For some reason, I felt like she owed me an explaination. This violated all sorts of assumptions and schema I had constructured around her: I felt lost and it was more personal. I was uncomfortable and it was obvious.
        </p>
        <p> I had not been ready. End of story. We should have talked about it. We should have discussed her intentions with this new partner. I would have wanted her to explain things to me. We did not get a chance to have those talks. I messed up a few times on the pronoun. I had asked "if she wanted salmon or chicken" instead of "if he wanted salmon or chicken", it happened three times in total. Needless to say, he was upset and she was upset. I simply was not prepared for that dinner.
        </p>
        <p> Two weeks later, I recieved an email in which she lashed out at me. There is nothing else to say she was definitely in the west pole. I understand now it was a defense mechanism, she attacked my character and she expected more from me. Frankly, I think she was coming to terms with the situation herself and she wanted me to be there always-already. I just wasn't. She called me transphobic and that set me off. I had volunteered and was volunteering at the time with at-risk HIV communities. I am friends with and was friends with a number of transexuals (mostly male-to-female) and I had never reacted in such a manner nor ever been accused of any kind of phobia. That led to me initially avoiding at all costs and then ultimatley defending myself. Through e-mails (which may have not been the brightest idea for either of us) we discussed the idiosyncrasies of sexuality. I asked her if she was bi. She said she wasn't. That she didn't consider herself a lesbian at all. For some reason, the way she said it and phrased it made me defensive. "What's wrong with being a lesbian?" I said. "Because your boyfriends looks like one." And I believe that pushed her over the edge. And then we were both off to the races again. She felt like I was judging her and she felt I was being close-minded.
        </p>
        <p> I still remember our last and final conversation on the phone. She told me she loved me and always would but could not be friends with me "right now". She still hasn't talked to me and it has been 5 years. She is still very happy with her boyfriend (the same boyfriend) as far as I have heard. I changed my phone number and I did not tell her. We are no longer friends on facebook. And it is a very painful eruption of a once truly beautiful friendship. We used to call each other kindred spirits. It is all gone now.
        </p>
        <p>My actions definitely made the entire situation worse. The initial avoidance of everything for weeks was typical north pole behavior. I would simply say I was too busy to talk. I had an exam. I had other priorities which upon revelation, may not have been the best attitude nor the most tactful response. I believe that e-mail may have been the backlash from feeling insignificant or me making her feel as if she wasn't that important. The truth was that she was one of the most important people in my life. I had taken her for granted and that was my fault. I had not realized it nor admitted it then yet, I should have paid more attention to her. I had been absent that entire year. The truth was I had been dealing with my own sexuality issues and coming out and blah blah blah...but maybe if I had listened to her and called her back more frequently. I would not be lacking her now. I should have spoken to her. I should have grown with her. I should have told her how much she meant to me and how beautiful of a person she was. How I admired her individuality and empowering stance in life. But I hadn't.
        </p>
        <p>After the last phone call, I truly did not believe that was the last time we would ever talk. I am just happy I told her I loved her too. So at the very least, she knows. That comforts me. I was in the south pole. I thought she needed to blow off some steam and she would come back and apologize. Clearly, that hasn't happened. I should have apologized more steadfastly instead of trying to shirk responsability. I should have faced it head on with her. She was trying to and I realize that now. Maybe she got tired of trying and needed a break. Hopefully the break will end one day, who knows.
        </p>
        <p>Now I am very confrontational with my friends especially if I am confused or unsure of anything (specifically when it comes to their significant others). I take far more care and concern in keeping in touch. If something important is happening I encourage all of them to tell me "something important is happening, call me, now." I do not leave any loose ends if I can help it. I believe that at the age of 23 when this all happened I was in a very selfish place. I was trying to figure myself out at the cost of a very precious person. And for that, I will always be sorry.
