      <p>My name is Ariana Katerina Vergara and I have spent my life in search of knowledge. I have been in school since I was 3 and finally at the age of 27, I am not in school yet, still pursuing new insights in programming. I don't believe in walls or barriers in any facet of my life so even though I am unfamiliar with C++, Javascript and Ruby, I am only slightly shaken. I love langauges it may be due to my love affair with France or because of my Peruvian background: regardless, it has led me to nurture a curiousity for coding. These computer languages are very distinct from the romance ones I am used to yet, they have their own syntax and sentence structure. It is foreign to me but with every passing day, I become a little more fluent. So, I am in Phase 0 at Dev Boot camp with the intention to start a new phase of my life. One in which the languages keeps on changing and I must keep up. To the left is my maltipoo-fluff dog Anana. I thought she was cuter than any selfie I could show you. </p>
