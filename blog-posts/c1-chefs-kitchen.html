        <p> DBC. Wow. I left the fireside excited. I am excited to go through the process myself. I love challenges. I enjoy them: at the time, I know I will be overwhelmed and occasionally frustrated--I may have to go for a run a few times yet if I come out of this a better person: give it to me. I am anticipating a very high-octane adrenaline rush sort of environment. A ton of minds all working towards a goal at a fast pace will inevitably lead to some conflict and also moments of utter happiness. I am sure it will be rigorous for my brain and as an individual, who needs time to process, this may be the arduous part for me.
        </p>

        <p>I am an introvert: according to Myers-Briggs as well as my own self-analysis, I am a very outgoing introvert. I am very friendly, highly-excitable and on first glance will always come off as an extrovert. However, if you every truly get to know me: I love my alone time. I need it. This confuses a number of people. "You are so outgoing, Ariana. I mean you are on [insert student organization here]. How are YOU an introvert?" The truth is I am. I need that time to reboot my batteries so when Shereef said that introverts may have a hard time at DBC: I commiserate. I am sure I will find some sort of outlet for my soul to cleanse whether it is yoga or just taking a walk. I will find a way yet it does freak me out.
        </p>

        <p>My expectations for DBC have not changed. i knew it was going to be a very fulfilling, arduous experience. And if this unit is any indicator for the future: I am going to learn a lot. And I am a member of the open-mindedness, humbling mindset crew: I think I am an utter work in progress and there is always something I need to work on or improve. A toast to the new paths I will forge.
