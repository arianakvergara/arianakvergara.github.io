        <p>In 2005, David Hansson launched a cross-platform web application framework which he called Ruby On Rails and often, now just called Rails. What is most curious to me in regards to Rails is that there seems to be an inherent philosphy among Rails programmers: a culture which breeds a certain kind of coder.
        </p>
        <p>Rails uses the Ruby programming language. Many say Ruby inherently reduces the amount of code necessary to run a program and that it was chosen for that reason: it also could have been because the creator was working on another project. David Hansson was initially working on an online project management application named BaseCamp in 2004. He had initially been creating BaseCamp with the PHP language. He found it initially repetitive and decided it was not the right way togo. He attemped again with JAVA and found it cumbersome. Finally, with Ruby, he found ease and 'pleasure'. Therefore, he stuck with Ruby.
        </p>
        <p>
        It is because of this Ruby choice that I believe a certain kind of culture was grown. Ruby is known for being a terse, uncluttered langauge that is not prone to repitition like Java. It streamlines inherently: less code is required to create basic structures such as classes or data fields. What is known as 'boiler plate code' is no longer a part of your programming life. Furthermore, there are gems. Gems are third party libraries. RubyGems is the package manager that makes it easy to create and share software librariies that will allow you to extend Ruby's competency. Gems help you build your application. Anyone can upload a gem to the Ruby Gems website and therefore, Rails updates every second.
        </p>
        <p>
        Rails is known for its emphasis on 'Convention over Configuration' as well as 'Don't Repeat Yourself' or DRY mantras. The first, COC, is a paradigm that intends to decrease the number of decisions that a developor must make. A developer only needs to specific unconventional aspects of an application. It refers to the norms of naming. When a convention implemented by the tool matches the desired behavior, it behaves as intended and therefore no written configuration failes are needed. Only explicit congiruation is required if one deviates from the norm. Such as, if there is a class Sale in a model, the corresponding table in the database should be called sales however if instead it is called "products sold" or "total sales", the developer needs to write code regarding these names. The ideology behind COC is that convention leads to less code and less repetition.
        </p>
        <p>
        DRY. The principle of software development that seems to be true everywhere is very strongly upheld in Rails. The goal is to reduce repetition. Do not ever repeat yourself.  Information should be placed in a single, unambigious place: this is defined implicitly by the rails framework. This ideology has led to heavy criticism but also can be understood as simply a way of truly creating a universal web language. If one works the 'rails way' then others will easily be able to unravel the 'rails way' as well. It is undeniable that there are a myriad of ways to go about launchign a web application but if one is to follow the 'rails way' it will be easier. Some programmers believe that there should not be a 'better way' unfortunatley, that does not seem to be the truth while using ruby on rails. Clearly, companies both start-ups and established tycoons such as Twitter used Rails there must be a reason behind the madness.
        </p>
        <p>In short, what is rails? It is an open-source web framework application. And it is a philosophy of design.
