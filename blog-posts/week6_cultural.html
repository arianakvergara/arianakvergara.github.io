        <p> Stereotypes are a part of life. I came to terms with that a long time ago. I am a rather different looking human. I am not the type of person you can immediatley call white or black or hispanic or asian. I look like a mix. It depends on what someone believes looks asian that I may come cross as "half-japanese." It depends on what you believe looks white that you may think I am "half-white." The truth is I am 110% Peruvian and because of this, I am undeniably mestiza: I am a mutt. And at the end of the day I am just a human. Who knows exactly what I am, but does it really matter? I honestly had not put very much stock in to what ethnicity you were or why it mattered in the beginning of my life then with age, my bubble popped.It became clear to me that most people feed in to these stereotype threats so maybe I should be aware of them. It all began in the real world of second grade: there, I learned that even though it may not matter to me, it very much does to society.
        </p>
        <p>In second grade, I was given the opportunity to expand my horizons and take math class with the Third Graders. At the time, it was utterly frigthening but also kind of exciting. The chosen few were Sarah Nguyen, Ayano Yamauchi and I: Ariana Katerina Vergara. This fabulous news was printed in the weekly school newsletter that was sent home in our big manilla Wednesday Folders. My mother always read the "Pipeline" and consequently showed my dad. My Dad's reaction was immediate and he did not seem pleased. I was confused but my Dad is a pretty esoteric guy. To my surprise,the next morning he drove me to school, actually parked the car and walked me to my homeroom. When I came home that day, he sat me down and told me that he went to talk to the principal in regards to the short article. The thing was, they called us a "select-few of asian students" and he wanted to clarify that we were hispanic. He went on to give me a lecture about Peruvian history: the achievements of the the Incas and how hard he has worked to overcome his own limitations. He went on to say that he was proud of me and to never allow anyone to assume who or what I was. I haven't. To this day, I will always correct people who may call me Mexican or Columbian or Japanese by mistake.
        </p>
        <p>Three months later, all the second graders were fated to take the dreaded ERB. I looked forward to these standardized tests and I always have. Obviously, I never admitted this on the playground or anywhere else for that matter. For the first time ever, I actually checked the Hispanic-American box and since then I have continued to do so. If my father had not put such important in to what we stood for or where I come from: I am not sure I would have startedto check off the box so young. Slowly, my little mind began to categorize people into boxes and then I realized who came along with me in the Hispanic-American box and who didn't. Frankly, I realized how alone I was in my box and that would continue for a very long time.
        </p>
        <p>Truthfully, I had never thought of myself as a racist however in the past 9 months I have come to terms with the fact that I may stereotype a tad too much. In second grade, I had no idea that asians had a reputation for being very studious and just plain old smart: I had never heard of Tiger moms to me they were simply Mrs. Nguyen and Mrs. Yamauchi. My girlfriend is white, midwestern white. She may be the whitest person I have ever dated: the fact I just said that is feeding in to the stereotype threat and she was the first person to ever call me out on my propensity to make generalizations. The truth is I do not judge people by their color but I may make remarks and jokes that feed in to rather negative frameworks and societal structures. I am very conscious of my language around her and now in my daily life. I must admit when I asked my friends from highschool and college if they thought I came off as racist--they all laughed and said I was probably the least racist person they knew. Then I began to realize that most of my friends who made off-color remarks were like me and from some sort of minority group. This minority group standing made me think that I could get away with not the most politically correct statements. Yet, our behavior does not help the struggle it in fact feeds in to it. Even now, I am working on myself and doing my best to be more open-minded in every aspect of my life. It is difficult but if not now, when? Aren't I just being just as ignorant as the guy next to me? Why add to the encroaching inevitability of stereotype?
        </p>
        <p> The stereotype threat has led me to a number of quandries in my life. I am a box within a box within a box. That is how I feel anyway. I may be put into a unique category because I am Peruvian (Hispanic), ("Latin American"): that is one box. I may have had an accent when I was younger because english truly was my second language: however, I overcame it. I have been lucky enough to be raised by two very academically, over-achieving parents who have given me nothing but the best education a girl could ask for. Many may consider this an anomaly for a Latina and it may very well be: yet it is my reality. That fact puts me in a very unique box which does not allow me to feel like I should  check off the Latino Struggle box. Without checking that box off, I am left feeling rather different or at least not what most people expect when they hear that I am Latina. Furthermore, I am gay which inevitably puts me in another box. Quite frankly, that box was the hardest to stomach for me personally. I definitely do not look like what most people think lesbians look like or what I intitially thought a lesbian looked like. So, with all of these boxes a, I at times boggle people's minds when they first meet me: I am unique. But aren't we all unique? I am sure every single person checks boxes and doesn't check some that you would want to box them in to. I am human and that will never change: so why box anyone?
