    <h2>When You Are Abstract and Random: You are kind of like a Jackson Pollock Painting...</h2>

        <p> As an abstract random thinker, I have to confess I feel like I am all clutter and energy: my personality is definitely one that does not believe in boundaries or limits. Yet, these random explosions of energy can leave you feeling like may work in bursts rather than at a consistent pace: this is the sort of critcism Jackson Pollock recieved during his artistic career. I feel you Jackson Pollock.
        </p>

        <p> Reading through the characteristics of an Abstract Random thinker, I definitely let out a *le sigh* or two. These sorts of thinkers sound like artists: creative and self-effacing, divergent and emotionally sensitive. I am most definitely a people person. Yet, these are the sort of traits which can work remarkably in your favor or leave you feeling utterly dismal. There is a lot of whimsy in there: ideals are not always easy to uphold. I believe with this sort of thinking style it is in my best interest to breathe, to calm down and to realize that every single mistake I make will not lead to the downfall of an empire. Furthermore, my mistakes are not that serious or grave: everyone makes them it is a matter of learning from them.

        <p> Recently, I was able to read my pairing feedback. One aspect of pairing I definitely need to work on is confidence level while navigating. I must admit that I believe I have become a lot more self-assured with every single pairing session (gracias a dios) and unironically enough, this is tangible as I am reading my feeedback. However, I must admit the remote pairing may be the difficulty for me. I like to see body language and getting to know people is crucial to my working/lifestyle. I know that aspect of pairing shall start at Phase 1 yet, I can't help but wish it happened sooner.
        </p>

        <p> Growth mindset is clearly a crucial part of DBC. Needless to say, we have been spoon-fed this from the moment we applied yet it is easier said than done. Coming from a tiger-mom formation, I can tell you without any sort of hesitation that I have been programmed a different way. Success was measured on a 100 point scale and I do think it may take me a little while to adjust to the new mindset. Life and failure have both taught me that inner-growth is far more important than concrete success: however, I must admit I am still working on this sort of creed. Yet, in all seriousness, my nephew is about to turn one-year old and I will do everything in my power to nurture his idenity with as a man who is not measured by a score on a test but what he actually learned while taking one.
