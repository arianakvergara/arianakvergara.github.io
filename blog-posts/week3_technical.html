        <p> From a simple google search, it becomes astoundingly clear that JavaScript is truly a  controversial language. Some praise it for being the backbone of web apps and browsing and others crucify it for its lack of security. Scrolling through the list of commentary online in regards to JavaScript, there are definitely 2 camps expressing extreme feelings on this langauge.It is rather impressive how these forums for discussion of JavaScript began as early as 1995 and have not lost steam until noe:2014. The same issues seem to be consistently voiced: however, in almost 20 years, JavaScript is still here. And in a world in which apps are born and laid to rest on the daily: it makes you wonder.
        </p>

        <p> By far,the biggest criticism of JavaScript is it's inconsistency in browsers. The fact that JavaScript on different platforms whether it be an older or rarer browser or a mobile phoen definitely is frustrating. There is no unifority. People call JavaScript "crippled" and all sorts of other adjectives because it is simply frustrating. It is a tiring process having to scan through endless lines of code trying to debug something that does not immediately give an error message is troublesome or if it only displays an error on a certain version of a web broswer. JavaScript has the uncanny ability to read through almost every possible line of code and respond to it in rather strange and illogial ways. It poses a serious time issue for most developers and I can see why: a debugger is evidently essential. These debuggers are out there and accessible. Yet, simultaneously, the use of JavaScript has clearly led to the onset of a slew of web applications and innovation that is undeniable.
        </p>

        <p>JavaScript was born on Netscape by Brendan Eich in 1995. It is predominately used on webpages. JavaScript is embedded or included on HTML pages and interacts with the Document Object Model (DOM) of the page. Basically, JavaScript allows you to load new page content or submit new data: it is used for animation of page elements and any sort of user-interactive content. Because JavaScript is so crucial in logging the user's input and activity it has become a tracker for a user's reading habits and browsing activities. Now web analytics and ad trackers are benefiting from the use of JavaScript. Yet it is this sort of client catalogue-ing that has led to such harsh criticism.
        </p>

        <p>
          My personal conclusion is that JavaScript has endured and will continue to be blasted. Regardless, it is not going anywhere there have been many attepts to replace it. Dart is the first that comes to mind. Google in 2011 unveiled Dart a web programming language with the blatant intention to ultimately replace JavaScript as the lingua franca of the web development world. Apple is working on the WebKit project with the intention to add a web facing language. Microsoft released TypeScript yet again these are all projects that are trying to replace JavaScript: we will see with time who comes out on top.
