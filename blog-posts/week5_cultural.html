        <p>I must admit that initially I dreaded the notion of pairing. I am definitely the type of person who likes solving things by myself at my own pace without worrying about being too slow or too fast. Woud it be boring? Or would I feel daft? What would it be like to meet someone on a google hangout: would it be awkward? Would it be swell? (Who says swell anymore?) Yet pairing, now, is something I look forward to. I learn a lot during these sessions not only about myself but code and what exactly makes me tic. Through the course of Phase 0, it has become starkly apparent to me that certain personalities allow me to either be more creative and to think more clearly: somehow, my brain functions at higher levels and things that would possibly be more arduous alone are easier pairing with someone else. I have my favorites and I have no qualms asking to pair with them at the beginning of a new week.
        </p>
        <p>However, these moments of pairing genius did not happen during my first few pairing sessions. In fact, with full disclosure, my first pairing session was by far my worst and that was clear in the feedback I recieved.(Did anyone else think the anonymous feedback was not so anonymous?;) And yet, it was these sessions that pushed me to be more vocal as well as made me realize what I do and do not want from a pairing session. I am more aware of time-management. I am unafraid of trying out some new ideas or at least giving myself the chance to make mistakes. I also pay more attention to everything that is going on during the session itself. I am naturally a lil bit ADD, actually I was 'diagnosed' with it in first grade prior to the hullabaloo of present day ADHD vs. ADD. I must confess I have never been on Adderall but can understand the appeal. Yet if I make a concerted effort to focus and not allow whatever flighty ideas to take over my attention: I can do it. This has also made the first 45 minutes of any pairing session very crucial to the success of the pairing. If I buckle down early, there is definitely less likelihood of wasted time and more efficient performance.
        </p>
        <p>What I have found during pairing sessions is that there can be a full gamut of emotions. I must admit I have been lucky enough not to be utterly frustrated or frazzled but I can easily see how that could happen. Frankly, I was so relieved on my last pairing sesion. If my idea for an empty hash had not worked out, it would have definitely left me crestfallen and utterly lost. I would have felt alone and in dismay and responsible for the whole debacle. However due to my success, there was utter joy, a little jig and arms raised in a touchdown formation. My partner and I were both feeling confident and on top of the world.
        </p>
        <p>The guided pairing sessions are my favorite. I truly do take to heart what the guides tell me. The opportunity to ask them questions and hear their feedback has led to my personal improvement in my code and in my methods. And the opportunity to pair with someone new who I have not had the chance to meet inevitably leads to some sort of self-englightenment/self-improvement which leads me to feedback.
        </p>
        <p>Feedback has been crucial in the course of my pairing-life. It became inevitably clear to me that although I have ease driving: I needed to work on and I must continue to work on my navigation. Even in my interview for DBC, I realized how truly poor I am at conveying my thinking in a vocal manner. I have never had to. Yet, with practice, and the purposeful intention to think out loud: my pairs have been able to  follow my train of thought. There are less questions and my thoughts are not only in my head but at least in the air. I will always encourage my partner to ask me questions if I jump around and go too fast. I appreciate anyone who keeps me on track with the releases and helps me grow.
        </p>
        <p>Reading and writing feedback is a very unique experience. I really did not know how to write ASK intitially but through the meta-feedback I have been able to make my own reviews more actionable. Frankly, actionable feedback is by far the most crucial for anyone and my initial reviews were lacking that. Now, I take the time to think about every aspect of the actionable, the specific and the kind feedback prior to inputting it into the feedbackinator. I hope those who recieve it find it helpful.
        </p>
        <p>I guess that reading my feedback solidified what I thought were my flaws. I knew that at times I definitely did not center my train of thought as I should have and after an hour, my attention may not be as targeted as it should be. It may have been difficult initially to read however, I would always encourage feedback now. It has definitely led me to being a better pair and more conscious of my faults. Furthermore, it also led to real friendships with some of my cohorts. The affirmation that a pairing session went well or that our pairing style is working for both of us has led to  feelings of comraderie. Basically, we are saying to each other: this works, let's pair again yo. This doesn't work, you should work on that.
