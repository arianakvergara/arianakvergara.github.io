        <p>Throughout DBC, I have visited many a question forum. I am sure you may have faced a situation like htis: You are looking. Your are searching. You are lost. That feeling gets inside of your soul: you feel like little red riding hood lost in the forums. You have played with your code for what feels like forever. You have looked over every line and finally you just have to google. The google search results pose another problem. Then, it happens. You found the answer to your question whether it was in w3school.com or stackoverflow: it doesn't matter. A smile creeps over your lips. You found your way to grandmother's house...your program is debugged.
        </p>
        <p> BUT, what if your question is not in the hundreds of posts. What should you do then? How to pose a good question is crucial. Only by asking the right questions will you ever be given the correct answer.Here are a few essential rules to live by:
        </p>
        <p> FIRST and foremost, it may seem very obvious but spell correctly. It may not be fourth grade yet, correct spelling is a fundamental. Why should anyone take the time to read or respond to your question if clearly you did not take the time to read through it. If you would like to go a step further, also take a look at your punctuation and grammar. I have read many a question with a hanging gerand and it did not make a bit of difference to me however, I am not responding to most quesitons I am simply scrolling through their answers.
        </p>
        <p>Secondly, the title is the thing. The title is the first thing an answerer will see: therefore, it is in your best interest to make it as interesting and simultaneously as simple as possible. You want to sum up the entire question in to one sentence. This may be painstaking but it will be worth it and it will also help me out when I come searching for answers. Also try to include any error messages, key APIS or unusual circumstances. It makes you more appealing. If you have any trouble writing the title: write your question first. Edit it. And then try writing the title.
        </p>
        <p>Title Examples:<br>
          Bad: C# Math Confusion <br>
          Good: What does using floating instead of int give me a different result when all of my inputs are integers? <br>
          Bad: if else problems <br>
          Good: Why does str=="value" evaluate to false when str is set to "value"? <br>
          Bad: Why doesn't this work?
        </p>
        <p>Next, upon having a title, now it is time to write the context of your question. Here you must show that you have put due dilligence into researching the issues/problem with your code: in other words, why other posts within that forum have not helped you and why. If you can explain why your code is unique that may also help. It also helps to share with the reader what your input is and what you would like your output to be. Showing your original code also is highly suggested and smiled upon. Summarize what your problem is. Point out why your code is failing. In other words, write an executive summary followed by a detailed description if at all necessary.
        </p>
        <p>Finally, tags. Tags are convenient for grouping your question with other similar questions. Tags allow for quick responses from experts: tags are composed of a word or phrase that describe the topic of the question. Tags group questions into categories and it behooves you to use them.
        </p>
        <p> Good luck questioning!! And don't get lost in the forums...
