        <p> Purity. That is the value that I most prize out of the list offered to me. Frankly, in times where I am the happiest, satisfied or proud of myself I never think of purity. Let's be honest, those moments are generated by achievement and feelings of utter competence, some personal display of excellence. Moments in which I for once feel some sort of inner peace generated by some sort of tangible manifestation of my effort. Yet moments in which there is something more: I guess I like to think those are pure. To me, those moments should not be of pride or vanity: I do not think of myself as the best or the brights, I do not really think about anything. And for me, these moments are achieved by displays of purity: those are the hardest for me to find or pinpoint. These seconds are rare which makes them priceless and almost ethereal.
        </p>
        <p>Achievement. Excellence. Competence. These are all values which through hardwork and great effort can be a part of your daily life. Dilligence I feel allows one to accomplish almost anything. The last time I truly felt like I had garnered any real validation of performance was the finish-line of my half marathon. It was a moment of serene happiness. After months of training and conditioning and hardwork, I had managed to run my half with an average mile of 9 minutes which was the goal. Yet moments like this I have had before in my life. Whether it was becoming a champion of my im hockey league or learning some particularly arduous piece of music, I have felt that supreme smug feeling before. Although, I prize them, I don't think of them frequently after I had them. Yet, I try to achieve me own maximum achievement everyday of my life. Doesn't everyone?
        </p>
        <p>Purity is an altogether different beast. Frankly, I feel like purity in any form is becoming scarce. I feel like every generation tests boundaries and limits: their elders always talk about the corruption of our youth and so on. It is a hackneyed trope but I guess, I am nostalgic at times like Frost or Whitman I just feel impure. I am nostalgic for a world in which I am not constantly attune to where my iphone is. I try not to be. I take great efforts in allowing myself to live in my own moment and not vicariously through my digital one: yet, it is becoming harder and harder. My girlfriend is always impressed that I can let go of my iphone for extended periods of time. My mother trained me from a young age not to be obsessed with AIM: it worked. However, I look at my nephew and he is not even a year old yet and he is truly obsessed with the iPad. I can't blame him. It is bright and colorful and sleek looking: dozens of people far wiser and older than he have waited in attrocious lines to buy that iPad.  I want him to be more intersted in a Birch tree than a playtime with an ipad.
        </p>
        <p>The purest being I know presently is my dog Anana and I can be undeniably myself around her. I love her and adore her and I know she feels the same way about me. She is purely herself. I wish I was more like her. The same goes for my nephew, I guess some of my favorite memories are just of him discovering something new and having supreme elation or sadness.
        </p>
        <p>I have no idea what pure exactly means. Clearly there is the Webster's definition of purity: "freedom from anything that contaminates, debases, pollutes etc." I believe that I have seconds of purity in which I allow myself to be or feel 100% whatever it is that I am meant to feel. Yet, who has time for that? There are so many responsabilities and things to do throughout the day in order to be a functioning member of society. I guess purity is a luxury and maybe I can't afford it.I know there are glimpses of it especially when I am around people I trust and love. Children and animals exhude this rather quintissentially gleaming pureness: but children grow up and reality takes over. I guess I should venture to more dog parks and spend more time with my nephew. That is where I can truly be myself and others can be too. There does not exist black or white or any sort of stereotype. Children are. They rae honest and are friends with each other because they like to play together: there are no alterior motives or gains. They make friends easily and do not ask silly questions like "Where did you go to school? What was your major?" It is a beautiful thing and now, I will attempt to get back there as often as I can...to a swinger of Birches like so many others before me.
