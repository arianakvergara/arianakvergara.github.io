  <div class="reflection">
    On my first day of this pairing challenge, I was lost. I had read all of the suggested resources and I had taken the time to complete Release 0 before but I was STILL lost. Frankly, my partner in crime and I had a not very successful session. It could have been a misinterpretation of isntructions or simply an off-day: but we started the entire challenge over: we had no choice. On the second day of pairing after getting some sleep and independently spending more time reading: we were fabulous. We managed to complete all of the requirements in a pretty decent amount of time. I have no idea if it was the space we took from the code or just a series of great guesses: regardless, I am grateful. I can now say I can play with responsive design and I know what is going on.

    Responsive design is by far one of the most pragmatic factors of web design by far. Clearly, it is literally enhancing user experience by making edits as the pixel size of a screen gets smaller. You are literally picking and choosing what a user is seeing as their browser windows becomes more and more compact.
